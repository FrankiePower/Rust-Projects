# **📌 Rust Project Learning Journal**

## **📝 To-Do List App (Day 1)**

### **1️⃣ Structs and Ownership**

- Learned how to define and use structs to manage data.
- Used ownership correctly when passing `String` values.

### **2️⃣ Borrowing and Mutability**

- Used `&self` for read-only access and `&mut self` for modifications.
- Modified `Vec<T>` elements using `.iter_mut()`.

### **3️⃣ Working with Vectors (`Vec<T>`)**

- Stored `TodoItem`s dynamically in a `Vec<T>`.
- Cloned strings to prevent ownership issues.

### **4️⃣ Pattern Matching for User Input**

- Handled user input errors gracefully with `match`.

### **5️⃣ Looping with `loop` for Interactive CLI**

- Used `loop` to keep the CLI running until the user exits.

### **6️⃣ Error Handling**

- Ensured safe user input handling with `.expect()` and `match`.

### **🎯 Final Takeaways**

✅ Mastered ownership, borrowing, and `Vec<T>` usage.  
✅ Built an interactive CLI with robust error handling.  
✅ Learned pattern matching for control flow.

🚀 **Next Steps?**

- Add persistent storage.
- Implement a delete feature.
- Filter tasks by completion status.
